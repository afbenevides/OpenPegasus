2019-08-07: TESTING layer repeats to make it stick

File: maker rook
Slic3r: 
layer thickness: 0.1 mm
first_layer_thisckness: 0.1mm
extruder width: 0.08 mm

TEST1:
(Build plate not yet replaced so it is not peprfectly straight)_

With working curve:
with light intensity to 90


laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 2

Result:

No bonding to build plate



==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 4

Result:

No bonding to build plate

==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate, but not printing other layers correctly

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate, printing only right/back side of rook ( what was printing had a pretty good quality)
NOTE: Added resing here

==================================
laser.repeat = 3
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate and bonding to pdms so like if there was no lift...
NOTE: problem forgot to screw back the build plate screw

==================================
laser.repeat = 3
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate and bonding to pdms so like if there was no lift...

-->try coming back to partial working

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate and bonding to pdms so like if there was no lift...

-->inscrease lift in beetween layers


==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm


Result:

Bonding to build plate, some layers on the build plate but stopped print at 75 on 356 layers, because no more bonding of later layers... all on pdms

-->try with 3 repeats?

==================================
laser.repeat = 3
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm


Result:

Bonding to build plate, some layers on the build plate but stopped print at 50 on 356 layers, because no more bonding of later layers... all on pdms

-->back to working conditions for (0.3mm layers) 

==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm


Result: No Stick to the build plate??? WTF


-->GO EAT AND continue later....!

==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm

-->GO EAT AND continue later....!

==================================
z calibration it is to change my ideas!

mounted mitutoyo dial indicator for z axis calib

launched z calib and set u 3 times
up
speed = 16 x 3 : 0.007 inch
down
speed = 16 x 3 : 0.007 inch

up
speed = 32x 3 : 0.014 inch
down
speed = 32 x 3 : 0.014 inch

up
speed = 64x 3 : 0.027 inch
down
speed = 64 x 3 : 0.027 inch

up
speed = 128x 3 : 0.055 inch
down
speed = 128 x 3 : 0.0545 inch

1 inch = 128*3/0.055 = 6981,8 steps
1 mm   = 128*3/0.055 /25,4 = 274.87 steps  WTF???

move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.370 to 0.568  = 0.198 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.568 to 0.766  = 0.198 in

test2 From down switch
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.265 to 0.436  = 0.171 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.436 to 0.634  = 0.198 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.634 to 0.831  = 0.197 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.831 to 0.929  = 0.198 in
hit max of dial

0.198in in most of tests for 1000 steps: z.scalein = 5050

z.scalemm = 199 will keep that for now....

changed build plate with new plate ( only had 0.125 in thick... but we will see)

did laser calibration, looks pretty good

bed leveling done

print test!

==================================

z.liftdistance = 3000 
Doobie Ini file 50 : 1st layer 0.35  others 0.3


Result: No Stick to the build plate

--> with doobie ini files 50 and try corners instead of middle

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 48
z.liftdistance = 3000 
Doobie Ini file 3 : 1st layer 0.35  others 0.3
belowlimit: 1600 

print files on each corners: 


Result: stick on 4 corners, no stick on center....

--> build plate is not straight and gap is higher in center or vat has a lower center...


==================================
Analysing this morning:

last print 5 rook (4 corners + middle)

if plate and vat leveled: 4 corners should be same thickness

rearleft: 0.96mm
rearright: 0.95mm
frontlft: 0.45mm
front right: 0.45mm

middle 1.10mm

--> will try at least leveling 4 corners same height and remeasure see if it corrects corner levels
for middle will try to increase cure time to 64 repeats.... we will see...

It also means first layer cures were at least lower than :

front: lower than 0.45
rear lower than 0.95
middle lower than 1.1

stopped at around 8 layers.... 0.45/8 or 0.95/8 or 1.1/8 ... does something that does not make sense
maybee z level bottom below limit switch is not good yet

==================================

laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 64
z.liftdistance = 3000 
Doobie Ini file 3 1st layer 0.35  others 0.3
print files on each corners:
belowlimit: 1600 
zliftdistance: 3000



stopped: layer 15

Result: 

rearleft: 0.614mm
rearright: 0.742mm
frontlft: 0.0.572mm
front right: 0.518mm

middle 1.094mm

--> retest correction on 3 corners

also since middle is same thickness and on pdms  maybe this is really the max penetration that laser can do in resin for 

==================================

laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 64
z.liftdistance = 3000

middle 1.086mm

--> no real difference so try lower thickness to 100um see if difference (on first layer??)

==================================

middle 1.154mm  to build plate yeah!

-->same sizes but lowering1st layer height 0.35 to 0.1 made it stick...

try to lower below limit to see if plate pushes vat so it bends an create a lower middle

try with xxx  repeat on normal layers




CREATE a LEVELING TEST PRINT WOULD BE VERY GOOD:

Something like printing a ruler on each corners with marks we can easily identify:


1-FLATNESS: -Verify build head is with very good flatness

2-SCREW scalemm parameter: verify with zcal an a microns rotary gauge (find real name)

3-setup calib file:
here is a base file that works for me:


4-FIRST LEVEL: Put a piece of papper in the vat(the vat is no easy to slip on, so the paper barrier makes it easier to slip another paperthingap beetween the build plate and vat paper)
-home the plate and adjust below home paremeter so it is only possible to pass a paper sheet(paperthingap) in beetween the paper sheet(on the vat) and the build plat.

5-FINE TUNE LEVEL:Print fine tuning leveling model

6 - if nothing sticks to build plate and something appears on PDSMS means (not enough cure or too big gap) 

to raise cure: raise repeat first layer parameter times 2  
to lower gap adjust leveling

( back to step 5)

7- if one or more corners are missing: adjustments of leveling : close gap in corner that is missing a print

( back to step 5)

8- if all corners appear: measure thickness and adjust leveling so that all corners have same height

( back to step 5)

9- if all corners appear and have same height but middle still not there: try adjusting by reducing below limit parameter to see if build plate is pushing vat down:

( back to step 5)

10- if all area are as eaven as it can be: try minimyzing first layers repeats

( back to step 5)

11-if minimal first layer repeat achieve adjust layer repeat to minimyze
keep in mind that layerrepeat multiplies first layer repeats so if you had:

laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 32

and want to change to 
laser.repeat = 8

than 

laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

so now:

laser.repeat = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

so normal layers are 4 times longer, and firstlayer is the same time


12- enjoy!


To be continued....
