2019-08-07: TESTING layer repeats to make it stick

File: maker rook
Slic3r: 
layer thickness: 0.1 mm
first_layer_thisckness: 0.1mm
extruder width: 0.08 mm

TEST1:
(Build plate not yet replaced so it is not peprfectly straight)_

With working curve:
with light intensity to 90


laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 2

Result:

No bonding to build plate



==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 4

Result:

No bonding to build plate

==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate, but not printing other layers correctly

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate, printing only right/back side of rook ( what was printing had a pretty good quality)
NOTE: Added resing here

==================================
laser.repeat = 3
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate and bonding to pdms so like if there was no lift...
NOTE: problem forgot to screw back the build plate screw

==================================
laser.repeat = 3
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate and bonding to pdms so like if there was no lift...

-->try coming back to partial working

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8

Result:

Bonding to build plate and bonding to pdms so like if there was no lift...

-->inscrease lift in beetween layers


==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm


Result:

Bonding to build plate, some layers on the build plate but stopped print at 75 on 356 layers, because no more bonding of later layers... all on pdms

-->try with 3 repeats?

==================================
laser.repeat = 3
laser.firstlayers = 4
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm


Result:

Bonding to build plate, some layers on the build plate but stopped print at 50 on 356 layers, because no more bonding of later layers... all on pdms

-->back to working conditions for (0.3mm layers) 

==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm


Result: No Stick to the build plate??? WTF


-->GO EAT AND continue later....!

==================================
laser.repeat = 1
laser.firstlayers = 8

z.liftdistance = 3000 ( from 2000 so according to scale 3 cm instead of 2 cm

==================================
z calibration it is to change my ideas!

mounted mitutoyo dial indicator for z axis calib

launched z calib and set u 3 times
up
speed = 16 x 3 : 0.007 inch
down
speed = 16 x 3 : 0.007 inch

up
speed = 32x 3 : 0.014 inch
down
speed = 32 x 3 : 0.014 inch

up
speed = 64x 3 : 0.027 inch
down
speed = 64 x 3 : 0.027 inch

up
speed = 128x 3 : 0.055 inch
down
speed = 128 x 3 : 0.0545 inch

1 inch = 128*3/0.055 = 6981,8 steps
1 mm   = 128*3/0.055 /25,4 = 274.87 steps  WTF???

move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.370 to 0.568  = 0.198 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.568 to 0.766  = 0.198 in

test2 From down switch
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.265 to 0.436  = 0.171 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.436 to 0.634  = 0.198 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.634 to 0.831  = 0.197 in
move 1000 steps with zup modified for 1000:   0.831 to 0.929  = 0.198 in
hit max of dial

0.198in in most of tests for 1000 steps: z.scalein = 5050

z.scalemm = 199 will keep that for now....

changed build plate with new plate ( only had 0.125 in thick... but we will see)

did laser calibration, looks pretty good

bed leveling done

print test!

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 6
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 6
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.3

Result: No Stick to the build plate


--> increase repeats and first layers

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 8
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.3

Result: No Stick to the build plate


--> increase repeats

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 16
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.3

Result: No Stick to the build plate


--> increase repeats

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 24
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.3

Result: No Stick to the build plate
measured thickness : 1,5mm  /8  = 0.1875

--> increase repeats

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 48
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.3

Result: No Stick to the build plate
measured thickness 1,9 : /8  = 0.2375

--> change layer thickness


==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 48
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.1

Result: No Stick to the build plate

--> leveling compensation with resin for front 

==================================
laser.repeat = 2
laser.firstlayers = 8
laser.firstlayersrepeat = 48
z.liftdistance = 3000 
layer thickness 0.1

Result: No Stick to the build plate

--> leveling compensation with resin : try to bring back closer.... redoo leveling tomorrow!
